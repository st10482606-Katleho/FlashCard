A report explaining the purpose of my application:The purpose of this application is to provide users with an interactive quiz experience focused on True or False questions. The app is designed to be educational and entertaining, allowing users to test their knowledge on topics such as the South African History.

Users can start a quiz, answer each question, receive immediate feedback, and review their overall score with corrections at the end. This encourages learning through repetition and helps users improve their knowledge in a fun and engaging way.

The app also includes features like retrying the quiz, viewing corrections, and a smooth user interface for better accessibility and user experience.
